# spark-ar-boilerplate
A boilerplate Spark AR project with Webpack.

Most of the magic is in the webpack config.

----

Updated for 2020 Spark AR. Cleaned up all files and simplified approach to run .arproj from root of project.

## Getting Started

- Clone or download this repository
- run `npm i` in the root folder
- Open the Spark AR project. If need to upgrade to another latest .arproj file, typically save the new copy of the Spark AR project, but also in root folder.
- Create a script asset called 'script.js' (typically, Spark AR default) for the .arproj project to initialise your localised `tsconfig.json` and `script.js` build into your the existing `/scripts` folder.
- The default tsconfig.json generated by Spark AR within `/scripts` only provides Intellisense of Spark AR libraries in the root of `/scripts`, and not anywhere else (not even within subdirectories) due to the setting `"include":["*.js"]`.  However, whenever you run `npm run dev` server to watch your files, it will check if such a file exists in your scripts directory and also attempt to modify the file by removing off the above setting, so as to allow Spark AR library typescript/intellisense access across all subdirectories under /scripts folder as well'
- `/scripts/index.js` is your default entry point to begin compiling your file.

## Usage

### Development
- run `npm run dev`
- this will watch your files for changes and automatically build the code into script.js file.
- when the code is rebuilt Spark AR should refresh on code change

### Production
- run `npm run build`
- this just runs the build once and outputs a minified file of `/scripts/script.js`
